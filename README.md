### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

We are the Home of Laboratory Automation Research (HÃ³LAR) at the University of Utah.  We are a specialized team under Professor Taylor Sparks' Research Group working on research and developing Autonomous Labs (a-lab), Self-Driving Labs (SDLs). Materials Acceleration Platforms (MAPs), and Lab of the Future [hint: they are basically the same thing].
